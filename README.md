A pit of experiments:
- Trying out DyalogScript and in general *idiomatic* APL for (imperative) AoC problems.
- Trying out *elegant* Haskell.
- Trying out the "Whitney C" programming style.
- Potentially trying out asm3bf to solve some problems in Brainfuck.

Of course, there are easier ways to solve the Advent Of Code. One of such ways is not using Brainfuck or deliberately obtuse C as your main programming tool.

Feelings about problems 1 - 3:
- Clearly written with imperative programming languages in mind.
- Algorithms in each language are generally very different.
- Haskell took twice as long as APL to write, C took a little shorter than APL.
- I approach every problem by starting with APL, then Haskell and finally C.\

Problem 4:
- The Haskell solution is simple and pretty, just like the C and APL ones.
- The APL solution uses a matrix inversion trick. 

Problem 5:
- Haskell was the easiest one, C was soul crushing I gave up on APL due to a RIDE bug.

Problem 6:
- Very easy compared to problem 5 in each langauge. C solution hardcodes inputs, since there's so little of them.
