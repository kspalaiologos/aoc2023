Feelings about problems 1 - 3:
- Clearly written with imperative programming languages in mind.
- Algorithms in each language are generally very different.
- Haskell took twice as long as APL to write, C took a little shorter than APL.
- I approach every problem by starting with APL, then Haskell and finally C.
