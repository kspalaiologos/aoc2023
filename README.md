Feelings about problems 1 - 3:
- Clearly written with imperative programming languages in mind.
- Algorithms in each language are generally very different.
- Haskell took twice as long as APL to write, C took a little shorter than APL.
- I approach every problem by starting with APL, then Haskell and finally C.\

Problem 4:
- The Haskell solution is simple and pretty, just like the C and APL ones.
- The APL solution uses a matrix inversion trick. 

Problem 5:
- Haskell was the easiest one. I gave up on APL due to a RIDE bug.
- C still pending.
