# aoc2023

A pit of experiments:
- Trying out DyalogScript and in general *idiomatic* APL for (imperative) AoC problems.
- Trying out *elegant* Haskell.
- Trying out the "Whitney C" programming style.
- Potentially trying out asm3bf to solve some problems in Brainfuck or SUBLEQ.

Of course, there are easier ways to solve the Advent Of Code. One of such ways is not using SUBLEQ or deliberately obtuse C as your main programming tool. But exploring less familiar ideas or trying out less weildy tools for the job slightly increases the difficulty level, which makes the tasks more interesting than solving them in Java or Python.
